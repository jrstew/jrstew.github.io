This is the academic page of Jonathan Stewart. 

I am a PhD student in the Department of Statistics at Rice University. 
My research is on dependent data with applications to network data. 
I am interested in understanding 
how to model dependent data for complex structures in order to obtain
tractable computational methods and desirable statistical theory in order to facilitate and validate
meaningful statistical inference.


I have studied applications to social networks, brain networks, and HIV / public health. 
My research has been published in both statistical journals and network science journals, 
and my software is avaiable as an R package from CRAN.
