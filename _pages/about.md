This is the academic page of Jonathan Stewart. 

I am a PhD student in the Department of Statistics at Rice University. 
My research is on networks and statistical network analysis.
I am interested in dependent network data,
that is networks with edge dependencies, 
and seek to better understand how to model networks with edge dependence 
and carry out statistical inference on such networks.  

I have studied applications to social networks, brain networks, and HIV / public health. 
My research has been published in both statistical journals and network science journals, 
and my software is avaiable as an R package from CRAN.
