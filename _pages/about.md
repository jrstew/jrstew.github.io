This is the academic page of Jonathan Stewart. 

I am a PhD student in the Department of Statistics at Rice University. 
My research is on networks and statistical network analysis.
I am interested in dependent network data,
that is networks with edge dependencies, 
and better understanding how to model networks with edge dependence 

I have studied applications to social networks, brain networks, and HIV / public health. 
My research has been published in both statistical journals and network science journals, 
and my software is avaiable as an R package from CRAN.
